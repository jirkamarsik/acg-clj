* Handle the optional features on hypertags.

* retrievec deserves a better name

* Decomplect Frilex from the toolkit

* Write tests!!!

* Rename :principal-type to :distinguished-type

* Maybe move everything form utils.clj to the place where it is
  actually used?
    * assoco -> check.clj
    * retrievec -> acg.clj

* Maybe represent terms using some abstract protocol which can support
  looking at the term either using its AST form or its human-readable
  form (lenses)

* As we enrich the type system, it would be a nice to a have similarly
  rigorous internal representation of types as we do with terms (ASTs).
